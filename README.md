To run the code, simply download the modules specified in requirements.txt. Then run py main.py (Windows), or python3 main.py
You can easily extend the functionalities of the app be subclassing the Base classes and overwrite the default functions.
There are still bugs in this repo that are not yet fixed: 
- The program crashes when an ant meets a new color

When ran, simply click on the grid to create a new ant. If you want to clear the board, click the refresh button.
To make the simulation run faster, or slower, or stop it, consider the colored buttons on the bottom right
To choose the simulation speed, input the step size into the Step input box
If you want a custom pattern/behavior for the ant, input L/R 's into the Behavior/Pattern input box
You can also change the name of the machine
